Line Sketcher is very similar to an echasketch, but instead of being a toy, it's a desktop application. To play the game, all the user has to do is move the arrow keys. A line will extend in the direction indicated by the pressed arrow key.

I created Line Sketcher using Java and [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/). JavaFX has lots of great tools for making desktop and mobile applications. This project helped me to strengthen my knowlegde and skills of the tools available in JavaFX.
