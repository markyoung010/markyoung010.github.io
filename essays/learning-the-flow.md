Before I began my computer science studies at UH Manoa, I equated the term 'software engineering' to the word 'programming.' That’s it. Nothing else. I thought, to be a good software engineer, one must be a good programmer. While this may be true, after having about 4 semesters under my belt, I now mainly view the term 'software engineering' as the sum of two other terms - 'Planning' and 'Teamwork.' 

In many areas of my life, I’ve noticed that things tend to go much smoother if I’ve made a plan. There are, of course, situations where spontaneity is preferred or cannot be avoided.  The situations that I feel are great for planning are tasks in which a definite outcome is expected, especially if this task has not been experienced before. This seems to me to be a characteristic of software engineering. 

From the little bit that I know about software engineering, I’ve noticed that quite a bit of planning goes into the creation of the software. Meetings, meetings, emails, and more emails. There could certainly be some programming involved during these planning phases, but it seems to be more important to create clear objectives for every step of the software creation process. Then there is teamwork. 

An overlap does exist between 'planning' and 'teamwork,' but when planning is no longer the main task and the programming begins, keeping a line of communication open with the team seems to be another incredibly important aspect of software engineering, even in the way the code is written. A programmer can write code for themselves or write code for others. 

What I mean by writing code for others, is that one writes code with an expectation that others will read it. Writing code for others, to me, is a form of teamwork because when writing for others, it seems more likely that the code will be readable, and therefore easier to debug and modify by anyone! This could result in more time being creative and less time trying to understand someone else’s code. 

I still have plenty to learn about software engineering. Even within my current view of the subject ('planning' and 'teamwork'), there is still so much that I do not understand. My goal is to learn this flow of the software engineer, and to be a valuable team member on every software (or non-software) organization that I join.
