Looking back on many of the programs that I have written, I noticed that I too often I have resorted to creating 
spaghetti code - unstructured and difficult-to-maintain source code. This happens from me, and who ever I am working
with for that project, tacking on code where ever we want, and creating long-winded unfocused functions. This is a 
terrible habit to be developing, and I need to stop before it becomes too ingrained into my way of thinking. I am
declaring right now that I am giving up spaghetti. That's right. **No more spaghetti code for this guy.** My goal now is 
to become very good at using design patterns, starting with the model-view-controller design pattern.
